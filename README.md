# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Prevous Coding Experiance 
My previous coding experience contains creating a discord bot using python that can be found [here](https://replit.com/@asherthethrashe/Alpha-Gaming-Factoid-bot) and contributing to another discord bot, i just started learning how to code last spring so I am slowly building me knowledge.  
## Why I'm taking this class
I am taking this class because coding has always interested me and I want to learn more about it. I also believe that coding will be an essential skill for later in life.
## Other Interests
Some other interests I have include
* Water Polo
* Diving
* Tech Theater
* Climbing and ropes activities
* Technology
## Goals for this Class
Some goals i have for this year are to learn a new language, maybe javascript, delve deaper into how to code with python for applications other than a discord bot, and possibly how to build a website for my bot.
